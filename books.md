# Books

I'd like to highlight a couple technical leaning books I've found either helpful or illuminating that I don't think get mentioned that much. There are several other more popular books I've really enjoyed (e.g. [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38315.Fooled_by_Randomness), [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17397466-an-introduction-to-statistical-learning), [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17744.The_Visual_Display_of_Quantitative_Information_2nd_Ed_)), but I often don't see the following talked about and I think that should change!
