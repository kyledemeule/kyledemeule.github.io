# Books

I'd like to highlight a couple technical leaning books I've found either helpful or illuminating that I don't think get mentioned that much. There are several other more popular books I've really enjoyed (e.g. [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38315.Fooled_by_Randomness), [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17397466-an-introduction-to-statistical-learning), [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17744.The_Visual_Display_of_Quantitative_Information_2nd_Ed_)), but I often don't see the following talked about.

### Debugging: The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems

Early in my software career I found that I spent a lot of my time debugging code, but that wasn't something I learned much about in school. I searched out for resources on specific techniques to better help with this task, and fortunately wound up reading [Debugging: The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3938178-debugging). The structured approach it describes to debugging took what was often a frustrating task to one of my greatest strengths.

The steps here also don't just apply to software development. Any system that is not working as expected from your TV at home, a data report at work, etc. can utilize the techniques here to isolate and find what is causing your errors.

### Observation and Experiment

The book: [Observation and Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34788009-observation-and-experiment).

### The Art of Scientific Investigation

The paradoxical title alludes to the fact that scientific investigation is often not obvious or prescriptive and has numerous struggles, road-blocks, and challenges that requires inguenuity and creativity to overcome. Written in the 1960s with many anecdotes from decades before, it's shocking how many parallels there are between early scientific discover and the modern business environment. Each chapter brings new insights and strategies to furthering your own (scientific) inquiry.

The book: [The Art of Scientific Investigation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2570722-the-art-of-scientific-investigation).

### Introduction to Probability

The associated edX course is one of the best courses I ever took.


If anyone is looking to expand beyond this, the preceding statistics courses is also of similar quality.

The book: [Introduction to Probability](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/517233.Introduction_to_Probability) and the associated [edX Probability Course](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data).
