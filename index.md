My name is Kyle Demeule. I'm a Data Engineer and Software Developer based in Vancouver. I've previously worked as a Data Scientist at [Clio](https://www.clio.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and as a Data Engineer at [Hailo Data](https://hailodata.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

I enjoy writing software and helping business create and maintain their data and reporting infrastructure. In my spare time I like to run, watch movies, and play hockey.

I received my Master's of Computer Science from [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, where I studied Data Mining and High Performance Computing. I also received a Bachelor's of Science in Computing Science from [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, doing co-ops at [Research In Motion](https://www.researchinmotion.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and [Metalogix](https://www.quest.com/metalogix/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
