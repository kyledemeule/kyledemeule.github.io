My name is Kyle Demeule. I'm a Data Engineer. I worked as a Data Scientist at [Clio](https://www.clio.com) and as a Data Engineer at [Hailo Data](https://hailodata.com/).

I enjoy what I enjoy. In my spare time I like to run, watch movies, and play hockey.

I obtained a Master of Computer Science from [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/), where I studied Data Mining and High Performance Computing. I also received a Bachelor's of Science in Computing Science from [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/), doing co-ops at [Research In Motion](https://www.researchinmotion.com/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), and [Metalogix](https://www.quest.com/metalogix/).

Check out my projects below, or see what I like to [read](./books).

## Projects

I've worked on some projects in my spare time or as part of school

**[Running with Prefect](https://github.com/kyledemeule/running-with-prefect)**: a benchmarking suite for heterogeneous systems. The primary goal of this project is to improve and update aspects of existing benchmarking suites which are either insufficient or outdated. See the live app [here](https://running-with-prefect.streamlit.app/)!

**[beginner.land](https://beginner.land)**: a minimal command-line utility written in Rust for querying GPU status.

**[SparkBar](https://github.com/BDHU/gpuinfo)**: a minimal command-line utility written in Rust for querying GPU status.

**[Ampliview](https://github.com/BDHU/gpuinfo)**: a minimal command-line utility written in Rust for querying GPU status.

**[Innertube](https://github.com/BDHU/gpuinfo)**: a minimal command-line utility written in Rust for querying GPU status.
