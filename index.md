My name is Kyle Demeule. I'm a Data Engineer. I worked as a Data Scientist at [Clio](https://www.clio.com) and as a Data Engineer at [Hailo Data](https://hailodata.com/).

I enjoy what I enjoy. In my spare time I like to run, watch movies, and play hockey.

I obtained a Master of Computer Science from [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/), where I studied Data Mining and High Performance Computing. I also received a Bachelor's of Science in Computing Science from [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/), doing co-ops at [Research In Motion](https://www.researchinmotion.com/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), and [Metalogix](https://www.quest.com/metalogix/).

Check out my projects below, or see what I like to [read](./books).
